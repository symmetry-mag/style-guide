The guide says: “Ethnic food. Ethnic music. Ethnic restaurants. Ethnic fashion. The word ethnic is frequently used to describe things that come from countries outside North America and Western Europe or cultures other than White. Like exotic, the word connotes otherness and can be seen as marginalizing and offensive.”</p><p>Instead of describing something generically as <em>ethnic</em>, the guide advises: “use the specific country or culture the food or music comes from. When writing about things from multiple cultures, use terms like international music, global food or world cuisine. In addition, the word ethnic should never be used to describe a person.”</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="ethnicity"></a>ethnicity<a class="hash-link" href="#ethnicity" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>In an <a href="https://consciousstyleguide.com/why-we-confuse-race-ethnicity-lexicographers-perspective/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">essay for Conscious Style Guide</a>, lexicographer Kory Stamper says most dictionaries define <em>ethnicity</em> as “a person’s cultural identity, which may or may not include a shared language, shared customs, shared religious expression, or a shared nationality (especially outside that nation’s borders).” It’s considered a more specific description than race.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.ywboston.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MISS_VIT_BLD-SUPP-FOR-MISS_TRN-AND-DEVEL_SJ-GLOSSARY_MARCH_2016.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YWCA guide</a> points out that “ethnic groups are self-formed and identified, whereas racial groupings were created by a single group and imposed on everyone else.” White settlers in North America, for example, grouped people from multiple, distinct ethnic groups into a single racial category labeled “Indians, American Indians or Native Americans.”</p><p>Stamper explains the importance of context in how the word <em>ethnicity</em> is used, saying: “Someone born to Japanese parents in the Bay Area of California and raised in San Francisco may identify racially as Asian (a broad category based on ancestral origin and some shared physical characteristics) but ethnically as Japanese, American, Japanese American, or maybe even San Franciscan (a cultural identity that can include shared customs, religion, nationality, or language). Or none of the above. The answer depends on who the speaker is talking to and why the listener is asking.”</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="race"></a>race<a class="hash-link" href="#race" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>In an <a href="https://consciousstyleguide.com/why-we-confuse-race-ethnicity-lexicographers-perspective/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">essay for Conscious Style Guide</a>, lexicographer Kory Stamper says that the definition of the word race has changed over time, but now “most dictionaries agree that <em>race</em> is often used to describe one of several very broad categories that people are divided into that are biologically arbitrary yet considered to be generally based on ancestral origin and shared physical characteristics (especially skin color).”</p><p>The <a href="https://www.census.gov/topics/population/race/about/faq.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website for the United States Census Bureau</a> says: “The racial categories included in the census questionnaire generally reflect a social definition of race recognized in this country and not an attempt to define race biologically, anthropologically, or genetically.”</p><p>The <a href="https://www.ywboston.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MISS_VIT_BLD-SUPP-FOR-MISS_TRN-AND-DEVEL_SJ-GLOSSARY_MARCH_2016.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YWCA guide</a> explains one historical use of the word race: “[a] theoretical invention of a European scientist used to separate and rank human beings into three distinct biological categories: Caucasoid (European), Negroid (African) and Mongoloid (Asian).” The European scientist was interested in asserting the Caucasoid race, to which he considered himself to belong, to be superior. (see <strong>racism</strong>)</p><p>YWCA describes <em>race</em> as “[a] social rather than biological construction.”</p><p>A <em>social construction</em>, according to the YWCA, is “[a]n unreal ‘real’ thing. Social constructions are not ‘natural’; they do not exist outside of language and human imagination; in this sense they are unreal. However, our way of life is built upon the belief in or dedication to socially constructed categories such as ‘race.’ As such, though ‘unreal’ social constructions have real world consequences for all of us.”</p><p>Those consequences come from <em>racialization</em>, which YWCA defines as “[t]he ongoing process by which we all are shaped by racial grouping or ‘racialized’ by structural policies/practices, institutional/organizational cultures, and interpersonal interactions.” <a href="https://www.raceforward.org/sites/default/files/Race%20Reporting%20Guide%20by%20Race%20Forward_V1.1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Race Forward</a>’s guide mentions that “[h]ow one is racialized is a major determinant of one’s socioeconomic status and life opportunities.” <em>Racialization</em> does not seem to be in many style guides, so do not assume readers know what it means.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="racism"></a>racism<a class="hash-link" href="#racism" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The <a href="https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/race-related-coverage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>AP Stylebook</em></a> defines <em>racism</em> as “a doctrine asserting racial differences in character, intelligence, etc., and the superiority of one race over another, or racial discrimination or feelings of hatred or bigotry toward people of another race.”</p><p><a href="https://www.raceforward.org/sites/default/files/Race%20Reporting%20Guide%20by%20Race%20Forward_V1.1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Race Forward</a> points out that “[r]acism isn’t limited to individual acts of prejudice, either deliberate or accidental. Rather, the most damaging racism is built into systems and institutions that shape our lives.”</p><p>It’s important to be specific when talking about racism. AP says: “The terms <em>systemic racism</em>, <em>structural racism</em> and <em>institutional racism</em> refer to social, political and institutional systems and cultures that contribute to racial inequality in areas such as employment, health care, housing, the criminal justice system and education.” The guide advises using these specific terms rather than shortening them to just <em>racism</em>.</p><p>As opposed to describing individuals as <em>racist</em>, AP recommends describing specific words or actions (or practices or policies) as <em>racist</em>—or, if it’s more appropriate, “<em>xenophobic</em>, <em>bigoted</em>, <em>biased</em>, <em>nativist</em>, <em>racially divisive</em>, or in some cases, simply <em>racial</em>.” AP advises against using terms such as “<em>racially charged</em>, <em>racially motivated</em> or <em>racially tinged</em>, euphemisms which convey little meaning.” It also recommends writers “[p]rovide context and historical perspective when appropriate to help convey the impact or implications of the words or actions.”</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="style-guide"></a>Style guide<a class="hash-link" href="#style-guide" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="antisemitism"></a>antisemitism<a class="hash-link" href="#antisemitism" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The <a href="https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/antisemitism-n-antisemitic-adj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>AP Stylebook</em></a> defines <em>antisemitism</em> as “[p]rejudice or discrimination against Jews.” This term should be written as a single word, not hyphenated to read  <em>anti-Semitism</em>, which the stylebook explains “could give credence to the [racist, pseudoscientific] idea that Jews are a separate race.”</p><p>The <a href="https://www.holocaustremembrance.com/antisemitism/spelling-antisemitism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance</a> explains: “The philological term ‘Semitic’ referred to a family of languages originating in the Middle East whose descendant languages today are spoken by millions of people mostly across Western Asia and North Africa. Following this semantic logic, the conjunction of the prefix ‘anti’ with ‘Semitism’ indicates antisemitism as referring to all people who speak Semitic languages or to all those classified as ‘Semites’. The term has, however, since its inception referred to prejudice against Jews alone.”</p><p>According to the AP Stylebook, the term “was coined in the 19th century by the German writer Wilhelm Marr, who opposed efforts to extend the full rights of German citizenship to Jews. He asserted that Jews were Semites — descended from the Semitic peoples of the Middle East and thus racially different from (and threatening to) Germany’s Aryans.” </p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="asian"></a>Asian<a class="hash-link" href="#asian" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Asian" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Merriam-Webster</em></a> defines Asian as “of, relating to, or characteristic of the continent of Asia or its people.” </p><p>But in its guide, <a href="https://aaja.org/2020/11/30/covering-asia-and-asian-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Covering Asia and Asian Americans</a>, the Asian American Journalists Association points out that the meaning of the term varies: “In some usage, chiefly British, ‘Asian’ refers to Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and others. In the United States, such ethnic groups would be known as South Asians, while Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese and others would be known as East Asians.”</p><p>Be more specific, if possible. If race is pertinent to the story, ask your source for their preference on what term(s) to use. Do not use the outdated term <em>Oriental</em>, which AAJA describes as “[a] vestige of European imperialism,” “a term of condescension” and “at minimum… vague.”</p><p><em>AAPI</em>, which stands for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, is an acronym “widely used by people within these communities” but may not be familiar to readers outside of them, the <a href="https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/race-related-coverage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>AP Stylebook</em></a> notes.

The author is Senegalese American.</em>”</p><p>AP recently updated its guidance on the capitalization of the word <em>Black</em>; it now advises writers: “Use the capitalized term as an adjective in a racial, ethnic or cultural sense: Black people, Black culture, Black literature, Black studies, Black colleges.” The stylebook explains: “Use of the capitalized Black recognizes that language has evolved, along with the common understanding that especially in the United States, the term reflects a shared identity and culture rather than a skin color alone.”</p><p><a href="https://www.nabj.org/page/styleguide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The National Association of Black Journalists style guide</a> “recommends that whenever a color is used to appropriately describe race then it should be capitalized, including White and Brown.”</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="blue-collarwhite-collar"></a>blue collar/white collar<a class="hash-link" href="#blue-collarwhite-collar" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p><em>Merriam-Webster</em> uses <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/blue-collar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>blue-collar</em></a> to refer to “the class of wage earners whose duties call for the wearing of work clothes or protective clothing,” and <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/white-collar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>white-collar</em></a> to refer to “the class of salaried employees whose duties do not.” The dictionary points out that the adjective <em>blue-collar</em> is often used to describe something “having, showing, or appealing to unpretentious or unsophisticated tastes.”</p><p><a href="https://globalpressjournal.com/style-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Global Press Style Guide</em></a> says to avoid using both terms, as they “are outdated, imprecise and force readers to make assumptions.” For the same reasons, the guide also recommends avoiding the similar phrase <em>working class</em>. Instead, “[w]hen relevant, provide precise descriptions of jobs, including local context, information about pay and working conditions.”</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="brown"></a>Brown<a class="hash-link" href="#brown" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The term <em>Brown</em>, a racial identity distinct from Black or White, is used by individuals from a variety of groups, including “Arabs, South Asians and Latinos,” notes philosophy and law professor Kwame Anthony Appiah in an <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/time-to-capitalize-blackand-white/613159/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article in the Atlantic</a>. But it’s not always clear which groups <em>Brown</em> refers to, as evidenced by a somewhat inconclusive episode of the radio show Code Switch, “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/12/11/569983724/ask-code-switch-who-can-call-themselves-brown" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ask Code Switch: Who Can Call Themselves ‘Brown’?</a>”</p><p><a href="https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/race-related-coverage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AP</a> says to “[a]void this broad and imprecise term in racial, ethnic or cultural references unless as part of a direct quotation,” as “[i]nterpretations of what the term includes vary widely.” <a href="https://www.raceforward.org/sites/default/files/Race%20Reporting%20Guide%20by%20Race%20Forward_V1.1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Race Forward</a> recommends erring on the side of being more precise, saying they “believe it is a better practice to actually name the group/ethnicity being referenced. For example, instead of saying, ‘Black and Brown,’ we would recommend saying, ‘Blacks and Latinos,’ if in fact, Latinos were the group being referred to in this case. ‘People of color’ can in some cases serve as a collective term for non-Whites.”</p><p><a href="https://www.nabj.org/page/styleguide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The National Association of Black Journalists style guide</a> “recommends that whenever a color is used to appropriately describe race then it should be capitalized, including White and Brown.”</p><p>In a comment in the “Conscious Language + Design” Facebook group on April 26, 2021, Karen Yin of <a href="https://consciousstyleguide.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Conscious Style Guide</a> recommended thinking about whom the term <em>Brown</em> excludes. “If certain groups of color are excluded from Black and Brown, and if racial discussions revolve around only White, Black and Brown people, then what happened to the rest of us?

Both disciplines tend to view Indigenous Peoples as remnants of the past, and many terms tend to denigrate and dehumanize Indigenous Peoples. They have often presented Indigenous Peoples as ‘primitive’ societies that should be documented before they inevitably develop into modern, Western-based peoples (i.e., ‘the vanishing race’). These precepts clearly go against the Indigenous cultural principles that Indigenous Peoples have vibrant, evolving cultures based on ancient fundamentals.” (pg. 52)</li><li><em>Elements of Indigenous Style</em> cautions writers and editors to watch out for “how the attitudes of colonialism are embedded in word choices,” explaining: “Colonial language communicates paternalism—the idea that Indigenous Peoples are not capable of thinking and acting for themselves.

The creation of the Women of Color framing came out of political discussions among social activists about how to represent the common needs of various women from Minoritized racial/ethnic communities.”</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="puerto-rico"></a>Puerto Rico<a class="hash-link" href="#puerto-rico" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Puerto%20Rico" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Merriam-Webster</em></a> describes Puerto Rico as an “island in the West Indies east of Hispaniola; a self-governing commonwealth in union with the U.S.”</p><p><a href="https://globalpressjournal.com/style-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Global Press Style Guide</em></a> says: “Do not refer to Puerto Rico as an island, as it is made up of multiple islands. Refer to the people of Puerto Rico as Puerto Ricans, only noting the terms of their U.S. citizenship when relevant to the story. Do not refer to the United States as the mainland.

Ewing explains: “Whiteness is not only an absence. It’s not a hole in the map of America’s racial landscape. Rather, it is a specific social category that confers identifiable and measurable social benefits… Perhaps the only thing more remarkable than the powers of this shield is its seeming invisibility, which permits White people to move through the world without ever considering the fact of their Whiteness. This is an incredible feat, through which White people get to be only normal, neutral, or without any race at all, while the rest of us are saddled with this unpleasant business of being racialized…When we ignore the specificity and significance of Whiteness—the things that it is, the things that it does—we contribute to its seeming neutrality and thereby grant it power to maintain its invisibility.”</p><p>If race is pertinent to the story, and your source is <em>White</em>, this is the one circumstance in which it’s not entirely up to them how they identify. The Radical Copyeditor explains in the article “<a href="#more-1452">Ask a Radical Copyeditor: Are There Limits to Self-Identity Language?</a>”: “When it comes to accurately describing dominant characteristics, that’s a really different situation. I don’t get to say, ‘I’m not white; that word doesn’t resonate with me.’ Regardless of whether or not I identify with the word/concept <em>white</em>, I am white. It’s an accurate descriptor. When a marginalized person claims language to describe their oppressed identity, they are <strong>speaking themself into existence</strong> in a society that is trying to annihilate them. When a privileged person rejects an accurate descriptor of their privileged status, they are <strong>refusing to acknowledge that they are privileged</strong>—that there are particular hardships they get a pass on because of this facet of who they are.”</p><p>You can be more specific, using terms such as <em>Italian American</em>. Avoid <em>Caucasian</em> as an alternative to <em>White</em>, because of the history of the term (see: <strong>race</strong>).</p><p>For more arguments in favor of capitalizing the W in White,
