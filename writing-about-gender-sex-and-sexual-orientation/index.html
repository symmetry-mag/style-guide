For some people, their gender identity does not fit neatly into one of those two choices.”</p><p>There are different aspects to gender, such as <em>gender identity</em> and <em>gender expression</em>. The GLAAD glossary defines <em>gender identity</em> as “[a] person&#x27;s internal, deeply held sense of their gender” and <em>gender expression</em> as “[e]xternal manifestations of gender, expressed through a person&#x27;s name, pronouns, clothing, haircut, behavior, voice, and/or body characteristics.”</p><p>The <a href="https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/gender-and-sexuality" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>AP Stylebook</em></a> clarifies that “<em>[g]ender</em> is not synonymous with <em>sex</em>. <em>Gender</em> refers to a person’s social identity, while <em>sex</em> refers to biological characteristics.” The organization Gender Spectrum notes on its webpage “<a href="https://www.genderspectrum.org/articles/understanding-gender" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Understanding Gender</a>” that <em>gender</em> is also distinct from <em>sexual orientation</em>: “Gender is personal (how we see ourselves), while sexual orientation is interpersonal (who we are physically, emotionally and/or romantically attracted to).”</p><p>AP notes that because “[n]ot all people fall under one of two categories for <em>sex</em> or <em>gender</em>, according to leading medical organizations,” writers should “avoid references to <em>both</em>, <em>either</em> or <em>opposite sexes</em> or <em>genders</em> as a way to encompass all people.” (see: <a href="https://symmetry-mag.github.io/style-guide/writing-about-gender-sex-and-sexual-orientation#agender" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>agender</strong></a>, <a href="https://symmetry-mag.github.io/style-guide/writing-about-gender-sex-and-sexual-orientation#bigender" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>bigender</strong></a>, <a href="https://symmetry-mag.github.io/style-guide/writing-about-gender-sex-and-sexual-orientation#genderfluid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>genderfluid</strong></a>, <a href="https://symmetry-mag.github.io/style-guide/writing-about-gender-sex-and-sexual-orientation#nonbinary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>nonbinary</strong></a>) </p><p><a href="https://transjournalists.org/style-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Trans Journalists Association style guide</a> suggests using the inclusive umbrella term <em>marginalized genders</em> to refer to the group made up of women, non-binary and trans people.</p><p>The Trans Journalists Association style guide notes that there are terms and concepts related to gender that are specific to certain communities. For example, some Native American communities may use the term <em>two-spirit</em>. As <a href="https://www.ihs.gov/lgbt/health/twospirit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Indian Health Services</a> explains:  “Traditionally, Native American two-spirit people were male, female, and sometimes intersexed individuals [referring to sex] who combined activities of both men and women with traits unique to their status as two-spirit people [referring to gender]. In most tribes, they were considered neither men nor women; they occupied a distinct, alternative gender status.”</p><p>In addition: “Most Indigenous communities have specific terms in their own languages for the gender-variant members of their communities and the social and spiritual roles these individuals fulfill; with over 500 surviving Native American cultures, attitudes about sex and gender can be very diverse. Even with the modern adoption of pan-Indian terms like Two-Spirit, not all cultures will perceive two-spirit people the same way, or welcome a pan-Indian term to replace the terms already in use by their cultures.”</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="sex"></a>sex<a class="hash-link" href="#sex" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p><a href="https://www.apstylebook.com/websters/webster-s-s-sex" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Webster’s New World College Dictionary</em></a> defines <em>sex</em> as “either of the two divisions, male or female, into which persons, animals, or plants are divided, with reference to their reproductive functions.” </p><p>The <em>AP Stylebook</em> clarifies that “<em>[g]ender</em> is not synonymous with <em>sex</em>. <em>Gender</em> refers to a person’s social identity, while <em>sex</em> refers to biological characteristics.” </p><p>The <a href="https://www.glaad.org/reference/transgender" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GLAAD glossary</a> says: “At birth, infants are assigned a sex, usually based on the appearance of their external anatomy. (This is what is written on the birth certificate.) A person&#x27;s sex, however, is actually a combination of bodily characteristics including: chromosomes, hormones, internal and external reproductive organs, and secondary sex characteristics.” Some people’s bodies contain a mixture of characteristics associated with the male sex and characteristics associated with the female sex.

Being <em>closeted</em> means denying one’s identity to oneself and/or others, but if one’s identity is man and one is living life fully as a man, one is <em>out</em>. When a person shares that they have a history of gender transition, that is a <em>disclosure</em>, not an act of coming out.”</p><p>On the related adjective openly, GLAAD says: “While accurate and commonly used, [<em>openly</em>] still implies a confessional aspect to publicly acknowledging one&#x27;s sexual orientation or gender identity.” NLGJA says: “As a modifier, openly is often relevant only when referencing historical figures and to allow for the possibility of previous closeted figures: <em>Harvey Milk was the first openly gay San Francisco supervisor. Tammy Baldwin was the first openly lesbian member of the U.S. House of Representatives.</em>”</p><p>NLGJA advises: “Avoid words like <em>acknowledged, avowed, admitted, confessed</em> or <em>practicing</em> because of their inaccuracy or negative connotations.”</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="pansexual"></a>pansexual<a class="hash-link" href="#pansexual" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The <a href="https://www.nlgja.org/stylebook/terminology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NLGJA stylebook</a> uses <em>pansexual</em> to refer to “someone who experiences attraction without regard to sex, gender identity or gender expression.”</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="pronouns"></a>pronouns<a class="hash-link" href="#pronouns" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The <a href="https://www.nlgja.org/stylebook/terminology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NLGJA stylebook</a> stylebook says: “If sources share a transgender or gender-nonconforming identity on the record, ask which pronouns they use and incorporate them into your report as needed. <em>They/them/their</em> are acceptable as nonbinary, singular pronouns if the subject uses them. Alternative nonbinary pronouns, such as <em>zie/zim/zis</em>, are acceptable if requested but may require extra explanation in a story or broadcast.” <a href="https://radicalcopyeditor.com/2017/08/31/transgender-style-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Radical Copyeditor</a> points out that some sources may choose to use no pronouns at all.</p><p><a href="https://transjournalists.org/style-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Trans Journalists Association style guide</a> says it’s generally best not to call attention to a source’s pronouns, explaining: “Reporters never write a sentence to explain a cis source’s pronouns. For example: ‘Jill, who uses she/her pronouns, attended the event.’ If we don’t emphasize cis people’s pronouns, we shouldn’t need to explain trans people’s pronouns — especially when they are common pronouns like he, she, and they.” But “[w]hen a source uses less common pronouns, it’s acceptable to have a quick, appositive phrase mentioning their pronouns. For example: Taylor, who uses ze/hir pronouns, attended the event.”</p><p>NLGJA notes: “Avoid references to <em>preferred</em> pronouns because doing so implies that calling people other than what they want to be called is a viable alternative. Avoid references to chosen pronouns because they are not always chosen. Instead, when relevant: <em>Sanchez, who uses the pronoun they</em> or <em>Sanchez, whose pronouns are they/them/their.</em>”</p><p>The Trans Journalists Association says to avoid using the terms <em>female/feminine pronouns</em> and <em>male/masculine pronouns</em>, as “[n]ot all people who use she/her are women, and not all people who use he/him are men.”</p><p>The Trans Journalists Association recommends “us[ing] someone’s current name and pronouns when writing about that person in the past, unless they tell you differently.” Also, “If a trans person contacts a newsroom or reporter asking for a story to be updated with their new name or to remove information that outs the person as trans, newsrooms should always make those changes when possible.”</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="use-of-the-singular-they"></a>use of the singular they<a class="hash-link" href="#use-of-the-singular-they" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p><a href="https://radicalcopyeditor.com/2017/08/31/transgender-style-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Radical Copyeditor</a> explains: “When using singular <em>they</em>, verb conjugations follow the same rules as those for singular <em>you</em>: <em>they did</em>, <em>they are</em>, <em>themself</em>.” Use the singular <em>they</em> to refer to an individual who uses they/them pronouns or to refer to an individual whose gender is not specified (to avoid awkward constructions such as “he or she is”).</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="queer"></a>queer<a class="hash-link" href="#queer" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The <a href="https://www.nlgja.org/stylebook/terminology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NLGJA stylebook</a> defines <em>queer</em> as “[o]riginally a pejorative term for gay, now reclaimed by some LGBTQ people.” The <a href="https://www.glaad.org/reference/lgbtq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GLAAD glossary</a> explains: “Typically, for those who identify as queer, the terms <em>lesbian</em>, <em>gay</em>, and <em>bisexual</em> are perceived to be too limiting and/or fraught with cultural connotations they feel don&#x27;t apply to them. Some people may use queer, or more commonly genderqueer, to describe their gender identity and/or gender expression.”</p><p>NLGJA says to use the term <em>queer</em> “with caution” as it is “still extremely offensive when used as an epithet and still offensive to many LGBTQ people regardless of intent.

Otherwise, describe <em>trans men</em> as men and <em>trans women</em> as women.”</p><p>AP says not to use the word transgender “as a noun, such as referring to someone as <em>a transgender</em>, or use the term <em>transgendered</em>.” It points out the transgender is “[n]ot synonymous with terms like <em>cross-dresser</em> or <em>drag queen</em> [or <em>drag king</em>], which do not have to do with gender identity” and advises against using “the outdated term <em>transsexual</em>.”</p><p><a href="https://www.glaad.org/reference/transgender" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The GLAAD Media Guide - Transgender</a> notes: “It is never appropriate to put quotation marks around either a transgender person&#x27;s chosen name or the pronoun that reflects that person&#x27;s gender identity.”</p><p>The <a href="https://www.glaad.org/reference/transgender" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GLAAD glossary</a> says: “Many transgender people are prescribed hormones by their doctors to bring their bodies into alignment with their gender identity.

This language questions a trans person’s gender by calling it an “identity” instead of just stating someone is non-binary or a man/woman. Journalists never write about cis people’s genders this way.

Transition can include some or all of the following personal, medical, and legal steps: telling one&#x27;s family, friends, and co-workers; using a different name and new pronouns; dressing differently; changing one&#x27;s name and/or sex on legal documents; hormone therapy; and possibly (though not always) one or more types of surgery. The exact steps involved in transition vary from person to person.” </p><p>Generally, you should use a trans person’s current name and pronouns even when writing about a time before they transitioned. <a href="https://radicalcopyeditor.com/2017/08/31/transgender-style-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Radical Copyeditor</a> explains: “Some trans people do use a different name and/or pronouns to talk about themselves prior to transition, but this is rare.
