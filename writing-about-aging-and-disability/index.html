Ask your source what they prefer.</p><p>The Americans with Disabilities Act National Network’s <a href="https://adata.org/factsheet/ADANN-writing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Guidelines for Writing about People with Disabilities</em></a> spells out some common categories used to describe types of disability: “visible/invisible; physical; mobility; sensory; cognitive; mental illness/psychiatric disability; and acquired/congenital.”</p><p>The guide points out: “Although some people with disabilities also have chronic illnesses, and some people have disabilities due to chronic illness, people with disabilities CAN be healthy. A disability is not a disease. Do not imply disease if a person&#x27;s disability resulted from anatomical or physiological difference (for example, a person with spina bifida). Do not refer to people with disabilities as patients unless their relationship with their doctor is under discussion or they are referenced in the context of a clinical setting.”</p><p><a href="https://ncdj.org/style-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NCDJ</a> points out that “[d]isability and people who have disabilities are not monolithic. Avoid referring to ‘the disabled.’”</p><p>AP recommends writers stay away from descriptions of disabled people “that connote pity, such as <em>afflicted with</em>, <em>battling</em> or <em>suffers from</em>” and says to “[a]void clichés such as <em>inspiring</em> and <em>brave</em>.”</p><p>Avoid using disability as a metaphor. As Rachel Cohen-Rottenberg writes on the website <a href="http://www.disabilityandrepresentation.com/2013/09/14/ableist-language/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Disability and Representation</a>: &quot;The stories that disability metaphors tell are deeply problematic, deeply destructive, and deeply resonant of the kinds of violence and oppression that disabled people have faced over the course of many centuries. They perpetuate negative and disempowering views of disabled people, and these views wind their ways into all of the things that most people feel are important. If a culture&#x27;s language is full of pejorative metaphors about a group of people, that culture is not going to see those people as fully entitled to the same housing, employment, medical care, education, access, and inclusion as people in a more favored group.&quot; </p><p>Writer Lydia X. Z. Brown suggests atlernatives to disability-related metaphors on their blog, <a href="https://www.autistichoya.com/p/ableist-words-and-terms-to-avoid.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Autistic Hoya</a>. For example:</p><ul><li>blind to/deaf to → willfully ignorant, deliberately ignoring</li><li>crazy/schizophrenic → wild, confusing, unpredictable</li><li>dumb/idiotic/stupid → ignorant, impulsive, foolish, uninformed</li><li>lame → boring, uninteresting, monotonous, uncool</li><li>OCD → fastidious, meticulous, hyper-focused</li></ul><p>These metaphors show up in writing about science and computing, in terms such as &quot;double-blind review.&quot; (Brown suggests the alternative &quot;doubly anonymous review.&quot;) The <a href="https://developers.google.com/style/inclusive-documentation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Google developer documentation style guide</em></a> suggests similar alternatives, replacing the phrase &quot;cripples the service,&quot; with &quot;slows down the service,&quot; and the term &quot;sanity-check&quot; with &quot;check for completeness and clarity.&quot;</p><p>In its <a href="https://rtcil.org/products/media/guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Guidelines: How to Write about People with Disabilities</em></a>, the University of Kansas Research &amp; Training Center on Independent Living points out: “People with disabilities are the largest minority group in America, and the only group that any person can join at any time—through disease, traumatic event, or other reason. Like other minority groups, there is much diversity within the disability community, and people with disabilities don’t want to be stereotyped when their stories are told.”</p><p>According to the University of Kansas guidelines: “If you adopt respect for the individual as your guiding principle, you can have an open conversation that acknowledges both the disability and the unique identity and shared humanity of all. <em>How do you describe yourself?</em> or <em>How should I describe your disability?</em> are simple ways to begin.”</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="handicaphandicapped"></a>handicap/handicapped<a class="hash-link" href="#handicaphandicapped" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The <a href="https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/disabilities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>AP Stylebook</em></a> recommends not using these terms as synonyms for <em>disability</em>/<em>disabled</em>.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="style-guide"></a>Style guide<a class="hash-link" href="#style-guide" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>This is a selection of more specific terms.

The fifth edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders consolidates all autism disorders under the larger autism spectrum disorder diagnosis.” NCDJ points out that “[s]ome people with autism prefer being referred to as ‘autistic’ or an ‘autistic person.’ Others object to using autistic as an adjective.” Ask your source what they prefer.

The term <em>caretaker</em> generally refers to a person who takes care of something, such as a house, when the owner isn’t present, or to a person or entity carrying out duties temporarily (<em>a caretaker government</em>).”  </p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="cripcripple"></a>crip/cripple<a class="hash-link" href="#cripcripple" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p><a href="https://www.apstylebook.com/websters/webster-s-c-cripple" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Webster’s New World College Dictionary</em></a> defines <em>cripple</em> as someone who is “lame or otherwise disabled in a way that prevents normal motion of the limbs or body.” The <a href="https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/disabilities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>AP Stylebook</em></a> recommends avoiding the term <em>cripple</em>.

Many people in the Deaf community prefer the use of the lowercase ‘d’ to refer to audiological status and the use of the capital ‘D’ when referring to the culture and community of Deaf people.” Always ask your source what they prefer; some deaf people do not consider themselves to be a part of the Deaf community.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/disabilities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>AP Stylebook</em></a> reserves the term “deaf” for “a person with total or major hearing loss.” Otherwise, it recommends using terms like “partial hearing loss” or “partially deaf.” Avoid the term “hearing impaired.”</p><p>NCDJ says: “When quoting or paraphrasing a person who has signed their responses, it’s appropriate on first reference to indicate that the responses were signed. It’s acceptable to use the word ‘said’ in subsequent references.”</p><p>NCDJ says to avoid the terms <em>mute</em> and <em>dumb</em>, as they “imply that communication is not possible.” Rather, “if someone uses American Sign Language, lip-reads or uses other means to communicate, state that.”</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="high-functioninglow-functioning"></a>high functioning/low functioning<a class="hash-link" href="#high-functioninglow-functioning" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p><a href="https://ncdj.org/style-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NCDJ</a> recommends against using these terms to describe people with disabilities. “Instead, use medical diagnoses and describe an individual’s abilities and challenges, rather than using less-specific labels.”</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="mental-illness"></a>mental illness<a class="hash-link" href="#mental-illness" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mental%20illness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Merriam-Webster</em></a> defines <em>mental illness</em> as “any of a broad range of medical conditions (such as major depression, schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, or panic disorder) that are marked primarily by sufficient disorganization of personality, mind, or emotions to impair normal psychological functioning and cause marked distress or disability and that are typically associated with a disruption in normal thinking, feeling, mood, behavior, interpersonal interactions, or daily functioning.”</p><p>If possible, avoid using this vague term in favor of naming a specific diagnosis.
