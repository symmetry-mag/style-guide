# Writing about people with dignity

Writing about people with dignity involves more than just using the “right” words. In the article [“Beyond Terminology: Zooming Out to Focus on Bias,”](https://consciousstyleguide.com/beyond-terminology-zooming-focus-bias/) Karin Yin, founder of Conscious Style Guide, recommends checking for bias in writing at four levels:


## Parity

Parity, or “how we treat people in parallel contexts.” For example, Yin writes: “If you’re going to make one person’s race relevant, make everyone’s race relevant equally.”
 
After two swimmers achieved historic firsts at the Olympics&mdash;Michael Phelps for earning a record number of gold medals and Simone Manuel for being the first African American woman in the sport to win an individual gold&mdash;a San Jose newspaper used the headline: “Michael Phelps shares historic night with African American.” After complaints that the headline unfairly erased Manuel, the paper changed it to: “Olympics: Stanford’s Simone Manuel and Michael Phelps make history.”


## Portrayal

Portrayal, or “how we present and describe people.” Prioritize being specific in your descriptions rather than generalizing.


## Framing

Framing, or “how we assign interpretations and conclusions.” Yin writes: “Consider these words: Sound vs. noise. Plant vs. weed. Religion vs. cult. We can infuse judgment into any description by selecting judge-y words, but often, judge-y words were selected due to an underlying racial bias [this also applies to other types of bias] about people’s nature and their motivations, and this affects how the whole event is framed.”

For example, in their [style guide](https://www.nabj.org/page/styleguide), the National Association of Black Journalists cautions against using the words *ghetto* or *inner city*, “[t]erms used as synonyms for sections of cities inhabited by poor people or minorities.” The guide says: “Avoid these descriptions because of their negative connotations. Often the name of the neighborhood is the best choice.”


## Representation

Representation, or “how we balance population, proportion and perception”&mdash;Yin writes: “Instead of returning to the same stories, casting the same characters, recreating the same associations, tell a different story. One way is by putting a spotlight on subgroups that experience erasure within communities already marginalized. The most visible are not representative of the community.”


## Final thought

As a final thought, Yin advises making sure the audience you picture when you write is a diverse one. Your audience includes all of the people described in this guide. To paraphrase Yin: Write *to* all members of this diverse audience, not just *about* them.
