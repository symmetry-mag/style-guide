01.13.22  
[aging](https://symmetry-mag.github.io/style-guide/writing-about-aging-and-disability#aging): Added new paragraph: The [American Psychological Association](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/bias-free-language/age) advises: "Do not use language that implies that all older adults are experiencing perceptual or cognitive decline or have health problems, or that all older adults are frail." If you *are* writing about an individual with dimentia, APA recommends against using the word 'senile,' which it describes as "an outdated term with no agreed-upon meaning." APA says to "specify the type of dementia when known (e.g., dementia due to Alzheimerâ€™s disease)."  
  
[dual heritage, compound nationalities/ethnicities](https://symmetry-mag.github.io/style-guide/writing-about-culture-ethnicity-and-race#dual-heritage-compound-nationalitiesethnicities): Updated the sentence "Do not hyphenate terms such as *African American* or *Asian American* when using them as a noun." Now "Do not hyphenate terms such as *African American* or *Asian American* when using them as a noun or adjective."  
  
[transgender](https://symmetry-mag.github.io/style-guide/writing-about-gender-sex-and-sexual-orientation/#transgender) and [references](https://symmetry-mag.github.io/style-guide/references/#references-for-writing-about-gender-sex-and-sexual-orientation): Updated link to [The Trans Language Primer](https://translanguageprimer.com/)
