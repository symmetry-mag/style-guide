01.13.22  
[aging](https://symmetry-mag.github.io/style-guide/writing-about-aging-and-disability#aging): Added new paragraph: The [American Psychological Association](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/bias-free-language/age) advises: "Do not use language that implies that all older adults are experiencing perceptual or cognitive decline or have health problems, or that all older adults are frail." If you *are* writing about an individual with dimentia, APA recommends against using the word 'senile,' which it describes as "an outdated term with no agreed-upon meaning." APA says to "specify the type of dementia when known (e.g., dementia due to Alzheimerâ€™s disease)." Added APA Style to [references](https://symmetry-mag.github.io/style-guide/references#references-for-writing-about-aging-and-disability).
  
[dual heritage, compound nationalities/ethnicities](https://symmetry-mag.github.io/style-guide/writing-about-culture-ethnicity-and-race#dual-heritage-compound-nationalitiesethnicities): Updated the sentence "Do not hyphenate terms such as *African American* or *Asian American* when using them as a noun." Now "Do not hyphenate terms such as *African American* or *Asian American* when using them as a noun or adjective."  
  
[Middle East/MENA](https://symmetry-mag.github.io/style-guide/writing-about-culture-ethnicity-and-race#middle-eastmena): Added the paragraph: The [American Psychological Association](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/bias-free-language/racial-ethnic-minorities) recommends: "When writing about people of Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) descent, state the nation of origin (e.g., Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Lebanon, Israel) when possible. In some cases, people of MENA descent who claim Arab ancestry and reside in the United States may be referred to as 'Arab Americans.' In all cases, it is best to allow individuals to self-identify." Added APA Style to [references](https://symmetry-mag.github.io/style-guide/references#references-for-writing-about-culture-ethnicity-and-race).  
  
[transgender](https://symmetry-mag.github.io/style-guide/writing-about-gender-sex-and-sexual-orientation/#transgender) and [references](https://symmetry-mag.github.io/style-guide/references/#references-for-writing-about-gender-sex-and-sexual-orientation): Updated link to [The Trans Language Primer](https://translanguageprimer.com/)
